    <h2>Q2:- Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML documents</h2>
    Ans:- The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers. <br>You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code. <br>
    <h4>Example of Comment</h4>
        <!-- This is a comment -->
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->

        <h2>Q3:- Write an HTML program that includes a heading a paragraph of text a horizontal line and a line break.Arrange these elements to create a simple web page layouts</h2>
        Ans:- <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
        <h4>This is heading 1</h4>
        The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        <h3>HTML Horizontal Rules</h3>
         <!-- The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: -->
         <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>This is heading 2</h4>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr>
        <!-- The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. -->

        <h3>HTML Line Breaks</h3> 
        <!-- The HTML <br> element defines a line break. -->
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

       <!-- Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: -->

       <h4>Q4:- Write a short note on Tag and elements with an example</h4>
       Ans:- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. <br>
       The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: 
       <!-- <tagname>    Content goes here...  </tagname> -->
       <h4>Examples of some HTML elements:</h4>

        <p>This is an HTML Element.</p>
        <p>The html tag represents the root of an HTML document.

            The html tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).</p>
            <h4>Q5:- What is th: DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML"</h4>
            All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. <br>
            The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
